As our ongoing process of iterative design, we began experimenting with prototypes following our first week of placement in our partnered Government department in January.

Having been presented with a brief recommending the reappropriation of the concept and functionality of the departments NatureNearMe app, we decided to take a step back and look into how people interact with heritage and the different needs of varying potential users of the app we are building.

Competitor analysis showed that there is an extensive list of meticulously researched and executed apps for visitors of Sydney and regions throughout New South Wales. This made us rethink the way people will interact with specific heritage sites on our app* and how we can better promote them.

*Worth noting is that for a range of reasons (including the ongoing cost of maintenance, barriers to user downloads and the competitive app market), the decision was made to create the heritagenearme app as a html5 website rather than a native app.

We decided to prototype and experiment with a “swipe to discover” mechanism to present users with a more engaging experience that gives more exposure to specific sites, without the user needing to know specifically what they're looking for. We hoped that this will engage people who otherwise wouldn’t spend the time to engage with heritage.


Take a look at some of our prototypes & try them out
=======

HTML5 Site
-----------

The live link to the progress html5 site can be found [here](http://heritagenear.me)

Take note that this is currently being built for mobile & has yet to be designed for landscape & larger device viewing.

Invisionapp Prototype
-----------

A more resolved design created from Sketch UI designs and prototyping tool Invision can be seen below. Or if you're viewing this on mobile, click [here](https://invis.io/GJ6BLAE5M)

Wireframes
-----------
Initial interactive wireframes for the current designs can be found [here](https://app.moqups.com/jesse@codeforaustralia.org/LyW9Bbazfb/view/page/a7cb0bb12)

Please note that navigation is problematic due to limited functionality of the wireframing tool for the needs of our concept.

We want your feedback!

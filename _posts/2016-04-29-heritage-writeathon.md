Through our initial needfinding with the heritage community, we heard a recurring theme of people being far from impressed with the current state of heritage item listings on OEH’s main site.  We also heard an eagerness for people to get involved and share content and information with the department.

We helped OEH organise a crowdsourcing initiative to allow people to become involved in the program and have their voices and stories heard. The initiative was launched coinciding with Heritage Week 2016 on Saturday April 2016. The event was launched at Sydney Living Museum’s Justice & Police Museum.

The initial launch event failed to draw in the numbers we expected. Which could come down to multiple factors, one major failure being the department's announcement the event two days before it took place. 

On a more positive note, we have received some great stories and feedback from keen contributors. We will be working with the Office of Environment & Heritage's content editors to moderate and approve the stories we have received. 

As all stories are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike license, we are currently working on making all those stories available in a shareable format.
We will gradually be adding the stories generated to the following public folder.

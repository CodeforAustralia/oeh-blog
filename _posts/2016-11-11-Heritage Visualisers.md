Over the past two months, I experimented with various data visualisation tools to communicate the various types of heritage in each local government area (LGA) throughout the state


During this exploration, I worked with the online platform Carto in an attempt to create visualiser templates that the Heritage Near Me team could alter and export when presenting and reporting to various LGAs throughout the state.


As data integrity is an enormous issue within the departmentâ€™s antiquated heritage database (which is being rebuilt under an ongoing project known as HMS), I explored the use of Google sheets add-ons and running queries in order to clean up and organise data.  


Some examples of visualisers created in Carto can be viewed below.

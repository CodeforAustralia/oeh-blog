Having received content from our Government partners in mid April 2016, we began prototyping UI solutions through wireframing.
Wireframing is important as it provides an understanding of space allocation of content, functionalities, navigation and information design. 

After drafting page after page of pen and paper wireframe sketches, online wireframing tool Moqups was used to digitise these concepts and test concepts out.

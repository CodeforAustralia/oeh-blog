While exploring potential avenues for exploration and development in early January, we discovered ‘Virtual Tours’ were an unspecified component of the Heritage Near Me (HNM) program. Fellows looked into potential low cost virtual reality (VR) solutions & how they may be incorporated and utilised in order to tell the story of the rich cultural heritage of NSW.

Documentation about what we proposed can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ptFd7K0-jNQi8fa2bgbFRaermIPzTINagl-nOp7urv4/edit?usp=sharing)

Note: This document was created on January 14 following a demonstration with the HNM team.

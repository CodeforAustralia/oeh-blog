Here's the blog for the Code for Australia NSW Office for Enviornment and Heritage [fellowship](http://www.codeforaustralia.org/about-the-fellowship).

We are Kenni and Jesse, the 2016 fellows working with the NSW Office of Environment & Heritage (OEH). Kenni is a full stack developer with a background in computer science and Jesse is a designer with a background in user centred design and innovation. 

We are currently working with the OEH to develop a html5 app as part of the ‘Heritage Near Me’ program to transform the way that heritage is shared and celebrated on a local level throughout the state. 

We hit the ground running very late last year and began engaging with the community to understand the needs of the community and potential ways in which we can create a solution that addresses their needs. 

Insights gained from our ongoing user research has allowed us to create rapid prototypes to show the department ways to create a more immersive and engaging user experience. 
We’re doing this through demonstrating the benefits of creating curated content, immersive UI and emerging technologies such as Google Cardboard and 360° photospheres.

We have begun prototyping with tools such as Sketch, Moqups and Invision and are currently in the process of coding a functioning, html5 site. Stay tuned for more updates and some examples of the work we’ve been working on so far.

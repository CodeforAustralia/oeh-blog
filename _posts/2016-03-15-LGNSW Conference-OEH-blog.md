LGNSW Tourism Conference 2016
=======

Last Wednesday I travelled to Byron where I met the Heritage Near Me team for the 2016 Local Government New South Wales Tourism Conference.

The event  themed 'Embracing a changing tourism landscape', focused on digital disruption as well as the impacts of new technology and demographic changes. Enter Code for Australia!

The conference was attended by councillors and council staff from local government areas across the state, industry professionals and guest speakers. This presented us with an opportunity to spread the word of what we are doing with the Heritage Near Me team, give people the opportunity to interact with our prototypes and gain an understanding of what local governments across the state are doing and planning to do to promote places and spaces throughout their regions.

User Testing

The Heritage Near Me team took me along to run a hands-on demonstration in the trade space throughout the conference. I took this opportunity to create a user testing session in order gather data and feedback. This was done through the creation of a feedback form asking users a range of questions about their experience interacting with the app, their travel/planning habits and thoughts on the inclusion of additional features. This was created using Google Forms.

Unfortunately, the busy nature of the trade space and the conference itself made it impossible to gather any responses through the feedback form from those in attendance. Despite this, the hands-on demonstration was still beneficial as it provided an opportunity to hear peoples thoughts on the prototypes.

At the OEH stall we loaded up an phone with the current live progress prototype, another phone & laptop with the work in progress Sketch/Invision prototype, a Google Cardboard headset displaying various NSW heritage sites & a business card promoting our online crowdsourcing story page. 

Verbal feedback was extremely positive with a bunch of councilors asking how much they would need to spend to have us do our thing with their departments.

Crowd Sourcing Heritage Stories
-----------

As a result of our initial and ongoing user research (there will be post delving into more about this soon), we quickly discovered that amongst the many heritage & historical societies there is a trove of knowledge, passion and experience which has lead to the development of a large quantity of engaging, exciting and interesting work in the digital space. We also heard an eagerness from the community to contribute and try to get more people involved with heritage.

We decided to create a digital form, again hosted through Google Forms, to allow people to become involved and have their voices and stories heard. The form is tailored to allow the writer to create content that is suitable for mobile and we have included some guides to help participants write engaging content. The form can be found [here](http://goo.gl/forms/ewLyGaRXjN)

We are also in the process of organising a writeathon style event with the department.

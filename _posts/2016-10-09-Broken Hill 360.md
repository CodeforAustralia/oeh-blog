Throughout the fellowship program, we have explored potential applications for 360 video and photography. 


During our initial trip to Broken Hill to consult with the community about potential ideas surrounding the code camp, I shot 360 photos at a number of iconic locations in and around town.


After returning back to Sydney, I created a proof of concept video to show the department just one way that they could showcase and celebrate Broken Hill's diverse heritage sites and places.


The original plan was to loan a 4K 360 camera rig from another project team within OEH to shoot in Broken Hill during the code camp week. However due to logistical issues, delays in the development of the MVP prototype and the need to jump through bureaucratic hoops in order to loan this camera rig, this was deemed unachievable and the production was outsourced to an external company.

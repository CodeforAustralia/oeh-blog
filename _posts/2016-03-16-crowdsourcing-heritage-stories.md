As a result of our initial and ongoing user research (there will be post delving into more about this soon), we quickly discovered that amongst the many heritage & historical societies there is a trove of knowledge, passion and experience which has lead to the development of a large quantity of engaging, exciting and interesting work in the digital space. We also heard an eagerness from the community to contribute and try to get more people involved with heritage.

We decided to create a digital form, again hosted through Google Forms, to allow people to become involved and have their voices and stories heard. The form is tailored to allow the writer to create content that is suitable for mobile and we have included some guides to help participants write engaging content. The form can be found [here](http://goo.gl/forms/ewLyGaRXjN)

We are also in the process of organising a writeathon style event with the department. 
For more info about how weâ€™re going about doing that, visit these links below.

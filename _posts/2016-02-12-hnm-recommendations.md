This is overdue...

In the first weeks of embedding with our department, we compiled a document of recommendations for the Heritage Near Me app concept.

These recommendations were made after conducting initial research - through need finding and competitor analysis, as well as community consultation. 

That document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_orXgYEta6626vcxKqkyzggY63Xi2YARpDDrWpdvhRQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Thanks for reading.
